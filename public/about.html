<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a dedicated web developer with a passion for building clean, responsive,
  and user-focused digital experiences. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS,
  JavaScript, and modern frameworks, I enjoy turning ideas into well-structured,
  functional websites and applications. I take pride in writing maintainable
  code and continuously learning new technologies to stay ahead in the
  ever-evolving web landscape.

<p>
  Beyond code, I value clear communication, collaboration, and problem-solving.
  Whether working independently or as part of a team, I strive to deliver
  thoughtful solutions that align with both user needs and business goals. For
  me, web development is not just about building websitesâ€”it's about creating
  experiences that connect people and technology seamlessly.
</p>

<p>
  In every project I take on, I focus on writing efficient, scalable code and
  ensuring performance and accessibility are never an afterthought. I believe
  great design and functionality go hand in hand, and I enjoy working closely
  with designers and stakeholders to bring intuitive interfaces to life. My goal
  is always to build solutions that not only work well but are a joy to use.
